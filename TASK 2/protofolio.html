                        Photography and videography are creative art forms that capture moments and tell stories through visuals. Photography focuses on freezing a moment in time, emphasizing composition, lighting, and perspective to create compelling images. Videography, on the other hand, brings scenes to life by recording motion and sound, crafting dynamic narratives. Both mediums allow creators to express emotions, document events, and share unique perspectives with the world. They blend technical skills and artistic vision to create timeless and impactful memories.
